[NumFOCUS][] will be applying again as an umbrella mentoring organization
for [Google Summer of Code 2020][GSoC]. [NumFOCUS][] supports and
promotes world-class, innovative, open source scientific software.

[NumFOCUS][]  is committed to promoting and sustaining a professional and ethical community. Our [Code of Conduct](https://numfocus.org/code-of-conduct) is our effort to uphold these values and it provides a guideline and some of the tools and resources necessary to achieve this.

[Google Summer of Code][GSoC] is an annual open source internship program
sponsored by Google. This repository contains information specific to NumFOCUS'
participation in GSoC. For general information about the competition, including
this year's application timeline and key phases involved, please see the [GSoC
website](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/)
