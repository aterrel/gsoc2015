# {{ Title }}
2D color maps

## Abstract

All of the color mapping in Matplotlib is currently derived from
`ScalerMappable` which as the name suggests maps scalers from `R^1 ->
R^4` RGBA color space.  It is common to want to map a vector to
colors, for example to control the alpha based on a second value in a
scatter plot or to show the orientation of a field.

## Open Source Development Experience

I have been an active contributor of Matplotlib for the last month. I have
fixed documentation as well as bugs.

- (Merged) #8094 Cleaned up documentation by removing an example
- (Merged) #8097 Improved the code to use plt.gca instead of plt.axes
- (Merged) #8154 Merged fill_demo and fill_demo_features examples
- (Merged) #8194 Added link to Gitter channel in readme
- (Merged) #8234 Fixed broken Gitter badge
- (Merged) #8343 Made ArrowStyle docstrings numpydoc compatible
- (Open) #8336 Merged three streamplot examples into one plot with subplots
- (Open) #8157 Added 'which' kwarg to autofmtxdate and wrote tests

## Other Experiences

- [AI-Bot](https://github.com/patniharshit/Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe) in python
  for 4X4 Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe.
- [Brick-Breaker](https://github.com/patniharshit/Brick-Breaker), a 2d shooter
  game in OpenGL.

## Why this project?

- Currently there are no multidimensional colormaps in Matplotlib. This is a
big nuisance if we want to modulate the color and opacity independently based
on data in different dimensions independently. Thus this project will greatly
improve visualisation of data in fields like neuroscience etc.
- Having used Matplotlib for displaying graphical information many times I
wanted to give something back to the community. Thus I think I am the right
person to do this project.

### Availability

My summer vacations starts on 27 April and college reopens in last week of
July. I don't have any commitments in summer and GSOC will be my full time job.
* **Time Zone :** Indian Standard Time (IST) UTC +5:30
*  **Hours per week :** 35-40 hours(during vacations), this may go down to
30-35 hours in August/September.
