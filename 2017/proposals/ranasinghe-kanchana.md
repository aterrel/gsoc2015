# Categorical Color

## Abstract
Categorical information (non-numerical like gender, favorite food, etc.) is quite common in datasets that we analyze. However Matplotlib support for plotting data is available mostly for numerical data, with few direct APIs built for categorical data. This project attempts to build an API for plotting heat-maps and other scalarMappables using categorical data. It will also work on developing normalization and color-map APIs supporting categorical data as these will be dependencies for the main API. 
Currently, users wanting to plot categorical data with color support in Matplotlib must manually map their categorical data to numbers, creating non-existent links between classes and requiring a lot of additional effort.

## Technical Details
With the widespread presence and usage of large datasets of varied nature, the analysis of categorical data has received much attention. Most machine learning, big-data analysis, and data-mining research and projects require the datasets available to be visualized at various stages of work. A variety of plotting techniques are utilized for this matter, and Matplotlib plays a prominent role as an essential tool for many researchers. Despite its diverse functionality with regard to numerical data visualization, Matplotlib is quite restricted in the domain of categorical data analysis. In most cases, user are compelled to manually map their categorical data to numerical data, thus introducing unnecessary relationships and patterns to the datasets, creating redundant data, and being withheld from the simplicity and ease of usage inherent to Matplotlib. 
This work hopes to tackle this issue to a certain extent. The Categorical Color Project will include two main tasks: building the heat-map and other scalarMappables API, and normalization and color-map APIs. Matplotlib currently has these frameworks set-up with functionality for numerical data. This functionality will be extended to support categorical data. The work of this project will be done solely using Python. Libraries used will include Numpy and Matplotlib. There will be no new (unused in Matplotlib previously) third-party libraries used in the course of this project. 
The work of this project will stem from existing development done categorical color support in Matplotlib issues [6889](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/6889) and [7383](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/7383). The starting point for the project will be extending the imshow function (matplotlib.axes._axes.imshow) to support categorical data. This mainly focuses on providing it unit knowledge with regards to non-numerical data. The approach followed here will be the initial basis for this extended support for categorical data. It will be used as a foundation to build the heat-maps API, and normalization and color-map APIs. 
Currently, the process of using matplotlib.pyplot for heat-maps and other scalarMappables includes the creation of a color-map followed by normalization of all available data to fit this color-map. Color-maps plotting functionality is threefold: sequential, divergent and qualitative. Considering the intrinsic discreteness of categorical data, the extension of the color-maps API will focus on its qualitative plotting ability. However the fundamental behavior of the color-maps API will require changes for handling categorical data as it is currently dependent on the presence of numerical scalar values in the data to be plotted. 
With regards to the normalization function, since this extension will require working with categorical data, the concept of normalization of data seems to be rendered useless. However, the possibility of integrating this into the APIs to be built will be evaluated. Also during the course of the project focus will be given to the currently available discrete normalization methods (matplotlib.colors.BoundaryNorm) which handle data in a different sense. 
Given this functionality, the final task is entwining all this functionality to allow the plotting of heat-maps and other scalarMappables. This will focus on providing units support for the existing functions with regards to categorical data, followed by integration of the existing frameworks (including those built previously in this project) to better support categorical data visualization. 
The completion of this project will require the creation of certain new classes for categorical data handling as well as extending of currently available classes and APIs.

## Future works

## Development Experience
I have been involved in programming work in python, MATLAB, Lua, Java, C and Micro C over the past three years. Some of my work is on [github](https://github.com/kahnchana). 
With regards to open source development, I have worked on a couple of issues on matplotlib and scikitlearn over the past few weeks. In addition, I was able to get involved in this natural language processing related project for CLTK on Pali Language (mainly because I am familiar with the language). The links of work done are below.

## Other Experiences
I have been involved in some machine learning and computer vision related research work, especially regarding [activity recognition in videos]( https://github.com/kahnchana/tcsvt2017). Currently I am involved in some work related to dense trajectories. I have also been involved in numerous mathematics related work since an early age, having also represented my country at the International Mathematical Olympiad while in high school. 

## Why this project?
I am quite interested in the areas of machine learning, computer vision, and robotics. As part of a machine learning research group at my university, I have constantly used Matplotlib for various purposes, including visualizing of certain categorical data. So I feel that I should try to get involved in contributing to the community as well. Also I feel a lot familiar with this project and find it interesting to work on mainly due to its relevance to data science.
