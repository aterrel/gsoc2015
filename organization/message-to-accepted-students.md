Congratulations! You already must have received an email from Google, your proposal has been accepted as one of the projects under the NumFOCUS umbrella for the Google Summer of Code this year. You should be pleased; you were selected from among many very high quality applicants.

Mridul and Henry are the GSoC Administrators for NumFOCUS. If you have any questions your mentor can't answer or have problems with your mentor please contact us first before you write to Google.

In this email you will find general information on being a NumFOCUS GSoC
student. You will also receive a email from your mentor with
information about working on your project soon.

1.  Good communication between student and mentor is important for
    your success at GSoC.

    If you have any problem with your relationship with your mentor,
    please contact one of the [administrators][admin]. We are here to
    help you.

2.  The coding period only starts on 7 June. From now until then we
    are in the "Community Bonding Period". During this period you
    should

    1.  Create a blog if you don't have one. There is a [guide][guide] available to
        get you started with [Github Pages]{GHP] and Jekyll.(You can use any other
        blogging platform, Wordpress, personal blog, medium, etc.).If you have trouble
        we can help you. 
        After you create your blog, you should [send us the link to it.][blog form]

    2.  Get to know your mentors better. We recommend scheduling an
        online meeting (IRC/Google Hangouts/Zoom ...).

3.  When the coding period starts you must

    1.  follow the "Schedule of Deliverables" of your proposal. It's
        OK if you need to change it a little as long as you talk with
        your mentor about it.

    2.  every two weeks, at least, write a blog post status report of
        your project. This way the rest of the project and NumFOCUS community can see
        the exiting new things your are coding. It's best if you
        go ahead and start writing a blog post during the community
        bonding period, to get in the habit.
    

Good luck, and don't hesitate to let us know if you need anything.
