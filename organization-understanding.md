## Scoring Students Proposals

Students proposals will be scoring following the description bellow.

## Guidelines to Select Accept Students Proposals

**Organization administrator** and **coordinators** will
discuss and accept/reject students proposal based
on the number of slots received and the score of each proposal.

related to projects that can only apply under NumFOCUS umbrella.

**organization administrator** and **coordinators**
will try to accept at least one proposal per project/organization
**if** the project/organization requested at least 3 slots.
