# Contributing Guide for Mentors and Sub Orgs
## Organizations Eligible Under NumFOCUS Umbrella

To be eligible to participate in GSoC under the NumFOCUS umbrella, an
organization must have:

1. One sub-org admin
   and at least two mentors (**the sub-org admin can be one of the mentors**)
   who are willing to commit for the full GSoC period.
2. NumFOCUS [Fiscally Sponsored][sponsored] or [Affiliated][affiliated] status
3. Have a good ideas page (**NumFOCUS Admins will help with that**).

The sub org administrator has the responsibility to communicate with
NumFOCUS and advertise GSoC to the community of their organization.

You can sign up as a participating org with us until the application deadline for
the current year or up to 3 days after Google announces that NumFOCUS is
participating as a umbrella org.

When you sign up with us you should also tell us your preferred way for students
to contact you and a link to your new contributor page if you have one.

## Sub Org Administrators

Each project/organization under NumFOCUS umbrella for GSoC should have one
administrator.

The **sub-org admins** are responsible for the following:

- provide a list of projects ideas to **organization administrator**
- advertise the application to the project/organization they represent
- sign up mentors with NumFOCUS
- connect users with NumFOCUS profile
- request to **organization administrator** a minimum and a maximum number of
  slots
- assign mentors and students to available slots
- ensure evaluations for accepted projects are submitted on time
- try to have the whole community engage with the students in their project

## Mentors

To be a mentor please tell your sub-org administrator so they can give you all the
information you need to sign up.

## Projects

Please make sure that the project can be partly completed during the summer so
that students pass the final evaluation. Please also read
the [student guide][CS], especially our requirements from students.

To ensure a project can be completed we recommend as a guideline that the
project should be possible to complete by the mentor in about one week of full
time work. This doesn't sound like a lot of time but students generally take
much longer then a long-time developer. They have to get familiar with the code
and have to acquire a huge amount of domain knowledge.

There has to be at least one primary mentor and one backup mentor per project.
This means you should have at least 2 mentors available. A mentor can only be
'primary' for one student but a backup for as many as they like. The sub org
admin can also be a mentor.

If you have a proposal you can use our [proposal templates][template] and
publish the ideas list here or you can link to an ideas list on one of your own
websites/repositories.
