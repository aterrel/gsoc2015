# {{ Title }}
2D color maps

## Abstract

All of the color mapping in Matplotlib is currently derived from
`ScalerMappable` which as the name suggests maps scalers from `R^1 ->
R^4` RGBA color space.  It is common to want to map a vector to
colors, for example to control the alpha based on a second value in a
scatter plot or to show the orientation of a field.

## Open Source Development Experience

I have been an active contributor of Matplotlib for the last month. I have
fixed documentation as well as bugs.

- (Merged) #8094 Cleaned up documentation by removing an example
- (Merged) #8097 Improved the code to use plt.gca instead of plt.axes
- (Merged) #8154 Merged fill_demo and fill_demo_features examples
- (Merged) #8194 Added link to Gitter channel in readme
- (Merged) #8234 Fixed broken Gitter badge
- (Merged) #8343 Made ArrowStyle docstrings numpydoc compatible
- (Open) #8336 Merged three streamplot examples into one plot with subplots
- (Open) #8157 Added 'which' kwarg to autofmtxdate and wrote tests

## Other Experiences

- [AI-Bot](https://github.com/patniharshit/Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe) in python
  for 4X4 Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe.
- [Brick-Breaker](https://github.com/patniharshit/Brick-Breaker), a 2d shooter
  game in OpenGL.

## Why this project?

Currently there are no multidimensional colormaps in Matplotlib. This is a
big nuisance if we want to modulate the color and opacity independently based
on data in different dimensions independently. This project has been requested
for a long time by people in neuroscience, astronomy etc.
Here are some of those requests :
- #4369
- [bivariate colormaps](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15207255/is-there-any-way-to-use-bivariate-colormaps-in-matplotlib)

Having used Matplotlib for displaying graphical information many times I
wanted to give something back to the community. I am the right person to do
this project because not only I want to contribute to Open Source but I have
also worked closely with the community for last month so I have good
understanding of workflow.
