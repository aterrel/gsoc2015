### Academic background

I'm currently pursuing my B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur. I'm in the first year of college. 

My skill set includes - iOS App Development using Swift, C, C++, Java, Python.

## Abstract

All of the color mapping in Matplotlib is currently derived from `ScalerMappable` which as the name suggests maps scalers from `R^1 -> R^4` RGBA color space.  It is common to want to map a vector to colors, for example to control the alpha based on a second value in a scatter plot or to show the orientation of a field.

## Technical Details

* This will require developing a significant new set of classes for Matplotlib, possibly parallel to possibly extending the existing 1D normalization and color mapping classes. 
* These classes will need to be exposed to users either as new API or extending the existing `ScalerMappable` API.
* In addition, a 2D color bar will be implemented and suitable color maps will be developed. 
* Presumably no extra 3rd party libraries will be used except numpy.

## Schedule of Deliverables

### May 1th - May 28th, **Community Bonding Period**

* Read the documentation, getting familiarized with the coding style and the community, version controlling, tests used and various systems the code will be deployed to. This includes going through the core documentation and getting to know how the code works by trying hands-on.

### May 29th - June 9th

* Trying the code for various examples and writing down various methods that can be implemented to solve the problem.
* Start to code the on-paper methods, presumably by creating new classes to extend the existing 1D normalization.
* Creating rough classes with incomplete attributes to test and try the algorithms. 

### June 12th - June 23th, **End of Phase 1**

* Complete the rough classes developed.
* Making programs to try the implementation.
* Fixing bugs.

### June 26 - July 7th, **Begin of Phase 2**

* Finishing the creation of 2D Colormaps.
* Adding exception handling.
* Start of 2D Colorbar. Jotting down algorithms.

### July 10th - July 21th, **End of Phase 2**

* Implemention of algorithms and testing the bar.
* Initiating development of color maps for the color bar.

### July 24th - August 4th, **Begin of Phase 3**

* Finishing colormaps for colorbar, checking compatibility with other classes.

### August 7th - August 18th

* Bug fixing, error handling and documentation of everything.
* Finishing documentation.
* Saving rest of the time as buffer for unpredictible scenarios. *

### August 21st - August 25th, **Final Week**

Buffer time.

### August 28th - August 29th, **Submit final work**

## Future works

Future work will include making improvements to the work-flow based on the feedback of this project. This will include working on issues and documentation coupled with working on the release version of matplotlib.

## Other Experiences

Currently I'm exploring Machine Learning and making a text based artificial intellegent machine to respond to my texts.

## Why this project?

* It interests me. Plotting applications amaze me and I always wanted to work on one since I first used a plotting application online. I would also like to explore more in open source and develop a stronger grip on python and Machine Learning in general.

* Matplotlib is an extensively used library for plotting. I've previously worked on matplotlib related to Colormaps. I found the code flexible and I loved working on it and would like to contribute more to the community.

* As I already have a fairly solid idea of what to expect and the workings of matplotlib I believe I can contribute to this project in a substantial manner.

## Appendix

#### Availability

I will frequently visit the dentist in May and June, but it won't take up much time.

On 22nd July, my college will reopen, and fortunately this date lies between the end of phase 2 and beginning of phase 3, so it won't affect the development.
